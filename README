Pintura is a cross-platform server side JavaScript based REST style web framework providing JSON/object storage with standards based HTTP client/server interaction. Pintura consists of reusable [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) modules and [JSGI](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html) middleware such that it can be used on any JSGI compliant JavaScript platform. Pintura forms the core of the [Persevere](http://www.persvr.org/) 2.0 framework which is designed for client-centric applications that rely heavily on Ajax-driven data communication from the browser.
