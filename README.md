is a cross-platform server side JavaScript based REST style web framework providing JSON/object storage with standards based HTTP client/server interaction. Pintura consists of reusable [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) modules and [JSGI](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html) middleware such that it can be used on any JSGI compliant JavaScript platform. Pintura forms the core of the [Persevere](http://www.persvr.org/) 2.0 framework which is designed for client-centric applications that rely heavily on Ajax-driven data communication from the browser. Pintura features:

* Create, read, update, and delete access to persistent data through a standard JSON HTTP/REST web interface
* Extensive dynamic JavaScript object persistence extensive with support for storage of dynamic property sets, arrays, dates, and more
* JSONQuery/JSONPath querying for powerful web-based querying
* Object capability model security, with facet-based programming approach to protecting and controlling access to resources
* Data integrity and validation through JSON Schema
* Extensive content negotiation capabilities with out-of-the-box support for JSON, JavaScript, and Atom representations of JavaScript persistent object resources
* Remote execution of JavaScript methods on the server through JSON-RPC for a consistent client/server language platform
* Comet-based data monitoring capabilities through HTTP Channels with Bayeux transport plugin/negotiation support
* Cross-site request handling and robust, solid cross-site request forgery protection
* Class-based data hierarchy object oriented data persistence
